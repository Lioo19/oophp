#README for oophp course

Here you'll find all the information regarding the creation of my redovisa-page for the course Objectoriented Webtechnologies, given at Blekinge Tekniska HÃ¶gskola spring 2020 (during roaring coronatimes, we did indeed get the roaring twenties).

The page is built with PHP with the support of the framework ANAX.
